Abstract: Batesian mimicry occurs when palatable mimics gain protection from predators by evolving a convergent phenotypic resemblance to an aposematic model species. While common in nature, the factors maintaining mimicry are not fully understood. Patterns of temporal synchrony (i.e., temporal co-occurrence) and model-first occurrence have been observed in several mimicry systems, but the hypothesis that predator foraging decisions can drive the evolution of prey phenology has not been experimentally tested. Here, using phenotypically accurate butterfly replicas (facsimiles), we measured predation rates on facsimiles of Limenitis arthemis, an imperfect Batesian mimic, and Battus philenor, its chemically defended model species, under four temporal treatments to test hypotheses about the importance of temporal synchrony and model-first occurrence in mimicry complexes. We predicted that protection for mimics would increase when predators learned to avoid the model’s aposematic signal right before encountering the mimic, and that this learned avoidance would break down over time in the absence of the model (i.e., extreme asynchrony). Surprisingly, we found that asynchronous model-first occurrence, even on short time scales, did not provide increased protection for mimics. Mimics were only protected under conditions of temporal synchrony, suggesting that predators rely on current information, not previously learning information, when making foraging decisions.
